# CleanTetris

A Tetris implementation built to demonstrate **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **layered architecture** principles in Unity/C#.

This project is not about gameplay complexity ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **code example** showcasing how to structure even a simple game using clear boundaries, dependency inversion, and testable domain logic.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Design Principles

- **Dependency Inversion:** inner layers never depend on the outer ones  
  (`Domain ‚Üê Application ‚Üê Infrastructure ‚Üê Composition`).

- **Explicit Boundaries:** each layer communicates only through dedicated interfaces and DTOs ‚Äî internal types and state remain encapsulated.

- **Reactive Event Flow:** Domain raises events ‚Üí Application dispatches ‚Üí Presentation updates.

- **Dependency Injection:** all dependencies are resolved in Composition via hierarchically organized contexts, ensuring clear ownership and lifetimes.

- **Vertical + Horizontal Slicing:** the project is divided vertically by independent features and horizontally by architectural layers, separating engine and business logic concerns.

- **Shared Kernel & Reusability:** common, game-agnostic mechanisms (e.g., bitmasks, di) are extracted into standalone libraries following SoC and reusability reasons.

## üèóÔ∏è Layers

### Domain
- Defines the **core feature model**, incapsulating its data structures, behaviour and state.
- Exposes **interfaces** for application layer to interact with.
- Pure C#, engine-agnostic.

### Application
- Coordinates domain logic and connects it with external systems via **presenters** and **use cases**.
- Defines those external systems' interfaces.

### Infrastructure
- Provides Unity-specific implementations of domain and app abstractions intended to be handled by **an engine** (input reading, scriptable configs, UI, rendering e.t.c.).

### Composition
- Acts as the **composition root**, wires Domain, Application, and Infrastructure implementations through dependency injection.
- Defines **lifetime, initialization order, and inter-feature connections**.
